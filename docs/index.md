# KeyHub Provider

This is the Topicus KeyHub Terraform Provider. It is used to interact with your Topicus KeyHub REST API.

The provider allows you to safely retrieve accounts, groups and vaultrecords and store groups and vaultrecords.


## Example Usage

We'll assume your Topicus KeyHub installation is externally reachable via "https://keyhub.domain.com". Replace this URL with your actual installation URL.

Create an OAuth2/OIDC Client Application through the console:
https://keyhub.domain.com/console/access

Write down the Client Identifier and Client Secret and use them in your terraform configuration. Do not keep your authentication credentials in HCL for production environments, use Terraform environment variables.

**For local testing:**
```terraform
provider "keyhub" {
  issuer = "https://keyhub.domain.com"
  clientid = "myclientid"
  clientsecret = "myclientsecret"
}
```

**Using environment variables:**
```shell
export KEYHUB_ISSUER=https://keyhub.domain.com
export KEYHUB_CLIENTID=myclientid
export KEYHUB_CLIENTSECRET=myclientsecret
```

```terraform
provider "keyhub" {
}
```
